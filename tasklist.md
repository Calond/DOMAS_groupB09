# Tasklist
- [x] Carspawns - check whether it is possible to spawn a car (model.py far enough from others)
- [x] Trafficlight detecting cars - trafficlights should be able to detect and count cars in their lane.
- [x] trafficlight communication - should be able to communicate the amount of cars and the direction it has to a board or to the correct light
- [X] car route - cars should be spawned with a "randomized" route that they follow
- [x] car characteristics - at first hard coded, but later randomized. car should have values for the speed/accelaration/etc one idea is that grid is translated to me
- [x] car pollution - adding a way for a car to produce pollution based on acceleration and speed -> Niclas
- [x] car deletion - after it reached it's destination the car should be removed from the map
- [x] processing generated map - correctly processing the generatedmap
- [x] data collection - the data produced by the cars should be collected for reviewing -> Niclas 
- [x] buttons or flags for parameter values - there should either be buttons or flags to set e.g. car spawn rate
- [x] graphs - the data that is being collected should be visible in real time in a form of graph -> Niclas 
- [x] legend - add a legend containing the agents
- [x] batch running - for cross fold validation we should be able to run the same test multiple times in a row.
- [x] standard traffic light cycles
- [x] headless mode - apply headless mode to the simulation
- [x] cars can see traffic lights
- [x] graphs - graphs should be added that show emission values and travel times -> Niclas 
- [ ] when a car is not able to stop anymore, run red light
